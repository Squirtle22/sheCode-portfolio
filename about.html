    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>WebDeveloper from Wiltshire, UK</h3>
    <div class="bio">
        <p>Hello, I'm Deanna Keel, a passionate junior web developer on a mission to transition from a rewarding career
            in childcare to the dynamic world of web development.
            <br>
            <br>
            My journey into web development began with a desire for a new challenge and a fascination with the endless
            possibilities that the digital world offers. While my background in childcare provided me with valuable
            skills in patience, empathy, and effective communication, I yearned for a career that would allow me to
            blend creativity with problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my work, I strive for attention to detail, a user-centric mindset, and a commitment to staying up-to-date
            with the latest web technologies and best practices. I'm a strong believer in continuous learning, and I
            eagerly embrace challenges as opportunities for growth. Whether it's coding, designing, or troubleshooting,
            I'm always excited to tackle new projects and expand my horizons.
        </p>
